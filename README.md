# Food-Delivery-Routing-Optimization
The dataset used here to implement the algorithm is 20 orders from Swiggy order history.
This notebook deals with solving the problem "Assigning the right delivery partners to the right set of orders at the right time".
A meta heuristic algorithm is implemented with constraints such as capacity of Delivery Executive, maximum distance allowed,etc.
Google Developer Tools API was used to implement a meta heuristic algorithm which solve the above mentioned problem.

# Results:
A minimum distance ~= 38km was calculate with a total cost of Rs. 113.
The optimal paths to achieve this cost were printed for each Delivery Partner.
