    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In last few years the food e-catering business have grown exponentially. This leads to increase in demand for better solutions which involve assigning orders to Delivery Partners optimally. This notebook deals a solution in the similar direction with the given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Porblem: \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is an extenstion of Vehicle Routing Problem. The added constraints are the capacity of vehicle, multiple pickup-delivery locations. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution: \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "During the last 50+ years a lot of research has been done on solving Vehicle Routing Problem. This notebook deals with one of the solutions which is implemented in the Google *ortools* library.\n",
    "This problem basically deals with trying out multiple combinations to get the smallest path. \n",
    "\n",
    "The alogorithm used in this notebook is local search options which finds an optimal solution. The time complexity is very high as it usually work well for small number of delieveres(upto 15).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the data size is very small (20 deliveries) the implemented algorithm is sufficient to find out the optimal results with given constraints on maximum capacity and multiple pickup-deliveries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Tools Used: \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Google Developer OR Tools, pandas, math\n",
    "\n",
    "# Assumptions: \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Since the distance coordinates are given in (lat,lon) format, \"Haversine\" formula is used to calculate the distance between any two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To simplify the data the *order_id* are assigned indices in range [1,20] and correspondingly the *rest_id* are assigned indices in range [21, 40]. Any *rest_id* correspond to *order_id + 20*\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Each restaurant already have at least 1 Delivery Partner. Since this algorithm uses a depot station which initially have all the delivery partners. The Delivery Partner starts from depot -> take order -> deliever -> go back to depot. Since we are dealing with multiple depots and to simplify the problem the ditance from depot to any restaurant or order location is assigned 0 so that it is not taken into consideration. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The solution tries to minimize the maximum distance travelled by any Delivery Partner and then calculates the total distance travelled by every Delivery Partner. The ditance parameter is set to the maximum distance between pickup-delivery location which finally also reduces the total distance travelled by all delievery executives.\n",
